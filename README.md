# Knightly-Trouble

## 1. Description
Our project involves the development of a two-player platform game using the Godot engine. The game will be inspired by classic platformers like Mario Bros, but it won’t be a direct copy. Instead of simply replicating Mario’s experience, we’ll incorporate unique elements. Can be build for Mac OS, iOS, Android or Windows.

## 2. Features
Although our game will have platform mechanics, we aim to create a distinct experience by focusing on the following aspects:

- **Level Design - Scenarios**: Levels will be designed to encourage cooperation between the two players.
  - _NTH_: There will be obstacles that require both players to collaborate in order to overcome them.

- **Visual Style - Graphics**: Retro, inspired by the Ghosts 'n Goblins style.

- **Innovative Mechanics**: We will introduce game mechanics such as special abilities for each character or specific interactions with the environment.

## 3. Practical Work Components
The project will include the following macro-level components:

- **Design and Programming**: Developing the levels, coding game mechanics, implementing multiplayer logic, and integrating visual and sound effects.

- **Visual and Audio Resources**: We will use pre-existing elements, which will require time for exploration.
  - _NTH_: We may also develop some of these resources ourselves.

- **Documentation - Testing**: Documenting the code and game mechanics, along with conducting tests to ensure the game works correctly in all scenarios.

- **Delivery and Presentation**: Preparing a game demo for the final course submission, along with a presentation to explain the design decisions and development process if required.

## Clone and open project

## Installing Godot 4 on macOS

To install Godot 4 on macOS, follow these steps:

1. **Download Godot 4**:
   - Go to the [Godot official website](https://godotengine.org/download).
   - Scroll down to the "Standard Version" section.
   - Under the "macOS" tab, click on "Download" for the latest stable version (Godot 4.x).

2. **Extract the Downloaded File**:
   - Once the `.zip` file is downloaded, locate it in your "Downloads" folder (or the folder you specified).
   - Double-click the `.zip` file to extract the application.

3. **Move to Applications**:
   - After extracting, you will have the `Godot.app` file.
   - Drag and drop `Godot.app` into your `Applications` folder.

4. **Open Godot**:
   - Go to your `Applications` folder and double-click on `Godot.app` to launch it.
   - If macOS blocks the app from opening (due to it being from an unidentified developer), right-click the `Godot.app` and select "Open," then confirm the prompt.

Now you can start using Godot 4 for game development!

## Running the tests

Open the project (project.godot) and press the button called "Ejecucion rapida de escena" (right & up side of the screen). After that, you can choose the scene to execute, look for the ones that end with the word "tests".
